# Book List Application

    In this project, I create a small Web Application to

track information(Author, ISBN, Title) about Books.
It will be a CRUD like I the C and R (Create and Read)

    I a topics like:
      - Class (JS)
      - DOM (JS)
      - Fading Notification for succes of failed action(JS)
      - Local Storage(HTML5)
            the list of displayed books remains unchanged
        even after reloading the page
      - HTML(Table)

## Deployment

Install
VS Code
"Live Server" Extension
Chrome

## Some Explications

I use clean.js because the skeleton link is to ugly.
